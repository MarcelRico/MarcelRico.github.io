This is me in the Fall of 2011:

I was a Physics major in those days, attending the University of Texas at San Antonio. It was then, that I first discovered I had a passion for Software Development.

It started out small really. Because I had a ton of Physics homework every week, I started looking for ways to make small programs that would help me with some of my math computations (calculators basically). Pretty soon though, I left the world of tiny standalone scripts behind,  and started diving into more intermediate programming concepts. 

Visual Basic was my first programming language, but before I knew it, I was learning Java, then C#, then Python. I ended up spending more time programming and building my "tools" then I did on my actual Physics homework. It was at this point that I decided to take my first Survey course in Computer Science. I've never looked back.

Technology itself has always been one my passions, and when I found out unfortunate as it was,  that I would not be able to continue attending my university for Financial reasons, I did the next best thing I could think of: Information Technology.

For the past  6+ years I've worked in the IT Industry, supporting many different types of clients, enviornements,  and applications. Though I do like IT, I can say safely after all this time, that it will never take the place of my love and passion for Software Engineering.

I joined Flatiron School because I know that its time for me to make the change. I want to use my knowledge, skill, and talent to develop robust, efficient and interactive applications. I want to be part of a team that I can contribute to, and to learn from those that know more than I do now, so that I can help others around me to become better in turn. 

Lastly I want do what I love, and that is why I choose Software Engineering.

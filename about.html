<p>Hey everyone I’m Marcel Rico, welcome to my blog!
<br />Born and raised in San Antonio, TX, I’ve spent the last 6 years
<br />working in the IT industry, supporting a wide range of clients, and
<br />applications.</p>

<p>As a nature person, I enjoy going for walks and hikes in my spare time,
<br />and visiting new and beautiful places. I have an amazing Fiance who has
<br />been extremely encouraging of my dream, and who I will marry soon in
<br />October of next year (2020).</p>

<p>Programming has been a passion of mine for years, and I’ve finally decided
<br />to pursue it. professionally, with a goal to be full-time Software Engineer.
<br />That Goal has led me to Flatiron School, I’m happy to be here, and look
<br />forward to working with all of you!</p>
